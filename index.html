            <p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Friends and money - oil and water.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. What's wrong with being a lawyer?</p>
            <blockquote>WOAH, THAT'S RADICAL!</blockquote>
            <p>Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name? Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English.</p>
